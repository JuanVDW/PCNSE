# Panorama: Device Groups

### Device Group Overview
* Similar as templates but for Policies and Objects
  * FWs belong to one device group or device group hierarchy
  * Settings are pushed to FWs when clicking Commit > Push to devices
* Hierarchical Device Groups are a bit different than template stacks
  * The inheritance is specified during the creation of groups
* PAN 8.1 allows max 1024 groups
* Common Device Group Organization Strategies are by firewall functionality, geographic location or other political boundaries
